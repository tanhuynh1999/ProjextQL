Passster is the best and simplest solution to password-protect your content.

== Description ==

= Features =

Passster makes password protecting your content easy. 

Complete pages, posts, products(WooCommerce) or only parts of them with the integrated shortcode.

You can also use a modern and secure captcha solution instead of a password. Modern encryption keeps sure your passwords are incredibly secure.

**Shortcode**
You can use the following shortcode to partly password protect your content:
[passster password="your-password"]your content[/passster]

You can also protect your content with a captcha:
[passster captcha="true"]your content[/passster]

**Free**

* restrict complete pages/posts/products with a password
* use a simple shortcode to protect parts of your content
* ajax-driven unlock - no page reload required
* modern and secure captcha with pure JavaScript
* customise the style with the Customizer
* use cookies to save access

**Pro**

* use multiple passwords per page/post/product and shortcode
* Google ReCaptcha v3 (invisible Captcha)
* password lists for large sets of passwords
* expire passwords after usage
* protect Visual composer rows
* auto-unlock content per user and user role

Paired with exceptional support directly from the developer, timely updates and feature integrations and extensive documentation you can't go wrong with Passster Pro.

**Documentation**

== Support ==

The free support is exclusively limited to the wordpress.org support forum.

Any kind of email priority support, customization and integration help need a valid premium license.

=== CODING STANDARDS MADE IN GERMANY ===

The plugin is coded with **modern PHP** and **WordPress standards** in mind. It’s fully OOP coded. It’s highly extendable for developers through several action and filter hooks.

Passster keeps your website performance in mind. Every script is **loaded conditionally** and all input and output data is secured.


=== MULTI-LANGUAGE ===

All major texts and information can be modified from the admin area of Passster.

The plugin is **fully translatable** in your language. At the moment there are only en_EN and de_DE, but you can easily add your preferred language as a .po/.mo.

It’s also fully compatible with WPML and Polylang.
